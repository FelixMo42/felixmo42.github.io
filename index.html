The answer must be in the attempt."</div><div class="bullet">- CÃ©line, Before Sunrise</div><div class="br"></div><div>I'm not at all a spirital person, instead I put my faith, love and interest in other people. I'm fascinated by how other people think. I wish I could crawl in peoples head and see how they view the world. I supect the lens people use and the way people think about the world differ more than most would suspect, even among similar people.</div></div><div class="section" id="todo"><div class="title"><a href="#todo">Topics I Want to Write About Here</a><div>25/2/2023</div></div><div>Post ideas:</div><div class="bullet">- oxford comma + gramerly</div><div class="bullet">- ego death</div><div class="bullet">- what is this site for ?</div><div class="bullet">- is it healthy?</div><div class="bullet">- whats with the name of this site?</div><div class="bullet">- the proper role of a robot</div><div class="bullet">- gender</div><div class="bullet">- does truth exist?

It's by far my least favorite emotion to feel.</div><div class="br"></div><div>But I do get it in some cases. The righteous fury at the oil barons who burn the world to add a couple extra zeros to their obsene bank accounts. The self-defensive hatred for thoses who hate you. An all encompasing rage at how much needless pain we allow to exist.</div><div class="br"></div><div>If these emotions are what you need to keep on moving, to make the world a better place, to live then I see the value in it. But I can't help but to think that it dosen't lead to the best places. An eye for an eye leaves the world blind.</div></div><div class="section" id="shame"><div class="title"><a href="#shame">Shame</a><div>25/2/2023</div></div><div>Shame has more contol over my life than I'd like. When I tell my friend about this some of them are suprised. I play a very zany and out there character.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I was taking the amtrak once and ended up talking to a group of socal workers a little order the me. When they asked what I did, I beant the truth of about motili and didn't mention that I worked as a software developer.</div><div class="br"></div><div>In general I feel shame about the parts of my the conform to hegimonic society. I feel shame about how much money I make, about my job, about some of my interest (books are my only cool interest). Even my interest in how to improve the world feels like I'm just trying to show off or shame people when I talk about it.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I don't think this is healty. I hope voicing this while help me change.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Fun fact: I actuall wrote the post on <a href="#anger">Anger</a> first, but reorginzed them to bury this. Have fun guessing what wierd edits I've made to le site!</div><div class="br"></div><div>Edit: This make's me sound far too cool. I'm also ashamed of a bunch of other regular things.</div></div><div class="section" id="toaism"><div class="title"><a href="#toaism">On Toaism</a><div>24/2/2023</div></div><div>My dad is fond of saying that happiness is reality minus expectation. He takes this and chooses to work on reality. Taoism is the idea to instead adjust expectations (in part, as far as my limited understanding goes).</div><div class="br"></div><div>Taking radical acceptance to its extreme says we shouldn't try to influence reality at all. Should the oppressed try to just be happy with their position? No, that seems unconscionable to me.</div><div class="br"></div><div>So, how do you determine what to change and what to accept? If I can adjust my expectations and be happy anywhere, then I think I should live in such a way to <a href="#utilitarianism">improve the lives of others as much as possible.</a></div></div><div class="section" id="utilitarianism"><div class="title"><a href="#utilitarianism">On Utilitarianism</a><div>24/2/2023</div></div><div>I think utilitarianism is pretty neat. Morality is ultimately subjective, but I like people to be happy and full of love. Utilitarianism is about maximizing that. If you think that there is a different moral philosophy that is better at making people happy, then utilitarianism says we should act according to it.</div><div class="br"></div><div>The only problem is that it's, like most things, very complicated in its simplicity. Will buying this or that have a positive postivie impact not only on my happiness, but on that of every other person alive now and in the future?</div><div class="br"></div><div>This understandably causes disagreement on how we should act. I have <a href="#toaism">opinions</a>, but not the truth. Hopefully the scientific method can help us approach it.</div></div><div class="section" id="free_will"><div class="title"><a href="#free_will">On Free Will</a><div>24/2/2023</div></div><div>Do we have free will?</div><div class="br"></div><div>Many people frame this issue as do we live in deterministic reality or do we have free will. I couldn't disagree more. I think to have free will we must live in deterministic reality. Or at least your brain has to be deterministic.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Imagine if we went backwards in time but didn't change anything and let your entire life play out again. Hopefully you would do exactly the same things as before given the same inputs. The alternative is your actions are random and free will is impossible.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Note: I'm not actually saying we have free will. To do that I would need to know what free will <a href="#ship_of_theseus">means to you</a>.</div><div class="br"></div><div>"If you could somehow examine a multitude of Martin Luthers across many worlds, I think you'd have to go far afield to find one that didn't defy the church, and that would say something about the kind of person he was."</div><div class="bullet">- Ted Chiang, Story Notes for "Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom".</div></div><div class="section" id="ship_of_theseus"><div class="title"><a href="#ship_of_theseus">The Ship of Theseus</a><div>24/2/2023</div></div><div>For the uninitiated: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">The Ship of Theseus</a> is a thought experiment about whether an object which has had all of its original components replaced remains the same object. If you replace all the parts of your bike slowly one by one over the years, when is it not the same bike? What if you build a new bike out of the old pieces of the bike?</div><div class="br"></div><div>I think the solution to this conundrum is very simple. Words and identity are imaginary. The reality of the situation is just molecules moving around. Saying 'ship' or 'my bike' are just labels we put over the infinitely complex reality. This allows us to simplify and communicate with one another, but it's important to never lose sight of the fact that words are constantly changing imperfect representations of the world.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Is water wet?

This would force me to <a href="#first_post">keep moving forwards</a>. For example: I edited the <a href="#date_format">previous post</a> so many times. I don't want to keep on revisiting it forever.</div><div class="bullet">- It forces me to keep the past around if I don't edit. Otherwise I'll keep everything in line with my current thinking and lose a connection with my past self.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Cons:</div><div class="bullet">- I wouldn't be able to improve or update documents where that might be a good idea. For example: I want to make a post about my philosophy for charity. I feel like that is something that will change a lot in the future. I'd like to be able to keep it up to date. Similar idea for a resume.</div><div class="bullet">- What if someone points out a spelling mistake? </div><div class="br"></div><div>Here's what I'm thinking: I allow myself unlimited ability to edit withing 24 hours-ish of creating a new post. After that I can only make edits for small things that don't change the meaning or character of a post (But even that I'm uncertain about. I think my spelling mistakes can be charming and add character). If I want to make big changes/updates I'll implements a versioning system to make it easy to go back and see previous iterations.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Luckily, I'm using <a href="https://github.com/FelixMo42/felixmo42.github.io">github for this blog</a>, so if I or someone else really want's to know the dates they can dig through the commit history.</div><div class="br"></div><div>If I change my mind I'll come back and edit this post. Or not edit it, depending on what choice I make.</div></div><div class="section" id="date_format"><div class="title"><a href="#date_format">How to Order a Date?</a><div>23/2/2023</div></div><div>Most of the world uses day/month/year for their dates. This makes sense to me. The second most common is year/month/day. This also makes sense to me.</div><div class="br"></div><div>The US, however, uses month/day/year. This does not make sense to me. At least with imperial units there are some countries that side with us, but we are the ONLY country to primarily use m/d/y. We just had to choose the worst possible option.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I will not bend to US hegemony! This site will use day/month/year since it's both the most common globally, and it's what's used in France.</div><div class="br"></div><div>To consider: y/m/d could cause less confusion since it can't be mistaken for m/d/y, whereas d/m/y can. In researching this I learned that y/m/d is almost exclusively used in asia. By preferring d/m/y am I just being eurocentric?</div></div><div class="section" id="first_post"><div class="title"><a href="#first_post">Just Get Something Done</a><div>23/2/2023</div></div><div>Everytime I think about working on this site I get caught up trying to figure out what the perfect first couple posts would be. I wanted to make sure it's not some silly small thought I have on my mind at the moment, but something meaningful. Something that made sense. This is very much a perfect is the enemy of the good situation.</div><div class="br"></div><div>This post seems like a good compromise to me. It both feels meaningfullish and makes sense as a first thing here. Hopefully this will open the way to write more nonsense. I find this want for perfection messes with me the most for writing.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Here's to getting something done!</div></div></body></div></body></html>
