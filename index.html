This would force me to <a href="#first_post">keep moving forwards</a>. For example: I edited the <a href="#date_format">previous post</a> so many times. I don't want to keep on revisting it forever.</div><div class="bullet">- It forces me to keep the past around if I don't edit. Otherwise I'll keep everything in line with my current thinking and loose a connection with my past self.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Cons:</div><div class="bullet">- I wouldn't be able to imporve or update long some documents where they might be good idea. For example: I want to make a post about my philosphy for charity. I feel like that is something that will change a lot in the future. I'd like to be able to keep it up to date. Similar idea for a resume.</div><div class="bullet">- What if someone points out a spelling mistake? </div><div class="br"></div><div>Here's what I'm thinking: I allow my self unlimited ability to edit withing 24 hours-ish of creating a new post. After that I can only make edit's for small things that dont change to meaning or character of a post (But even that I'm uncertain about. I think my spelling mistakes can be charming.) If I want to make big changes/updates I'll implements a versioning system to make it easy to go back and see previous iterations.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Luckily, I'm using <a href="https://github.com/FelixMo42/felixmo42.github.io">github for this blog</a>, so if I or someone else really want's to know the dates they can dig throught the commit history.</div><div class="br"></div><div>If I change my mind I'll come back and edit this post. Or not edit it, depending on what choice I make.</div></div><div class="section" id="date_format"><div class="title"><a href="#date_format">How to Order a Date?</a><div>23/2/2023</div></div><div class="br"></div><div>Most of the world uses day/month/year for their dates. This makes sense to me. The second most common is year/month/day. This also makes sense to me.</div><div class="br"></div><div>The US, however, uses month/day/year. This does not make sense to me. At least with imperial units there are some countries that side with us, but we are the ONLY country to primarily use m/d/y. We just had to choose the worst possible option.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I will not bend to US hegemony! This site will use day/month/year since it's both the most common globally, and it's what's used in France.</div><div class="br"></div><div>To consider: y/m/d could cause less confusion since it can't be mistaken for m/d/y, whereas d/m/y can. In researching this I learned that y/m/d is almost exclusively used in asia. By preferring d/m/y am I just being eurocentric?</div></div><div class="section" id="first_post"><div class="title"><a href="#first_post">Just Get Something Done</a><div>23/2/2023</div></div><div class="br"></div><div>Everytime I think about working on this site I get caught up trying to figure out what the perfect first couple posts would be. I wanted to make sure it's not some silly small thought I have on my mind at the moment, but something meaningful. Something that made sense. This is very much a perfect is the enemy of the good situation.</div><div class="br"></div><div>This post seems like a good compromise to me. It both feels meaningfullish and makes sense as a first thing here. Hopefully this will open the way to write more nonsense. I find this want for perfection messes with me the most for writing.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Here's to getting something done!</div><div class="br"></div></div></body></div></body></html>
