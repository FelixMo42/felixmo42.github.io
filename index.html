I wanted to make sure it's not some silly small thought I have on my mind at the moment, but something meaningful. Something that made sense. This is very much a perfect is the enemy of the good situation.</div><div>This post seems like a good compromise to me. It both feels meaningfullish and makes sense as a first thing here. Hopefully this will open the way to write more nonsense. I find this want for perfection messes with me the most for writing.</div><div>Here's to getting something done!</div></div></body></div></body></html>
