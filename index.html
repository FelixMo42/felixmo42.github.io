I'm of two minds when it comes to this.</div><div class="br"></div><div>On one hand I belive the key to happiness is having low standards. Not caring allows me to be fine in more situations and gives me more flexibility. It also gives me more more time to do other things in my limited life that I'd rather be doing than cleaning.</div><div class="br"></div><div>On the other, I kinda hate how this fit's into standard male stereotypes. But I don't think this is a very good reason. Doing something just to fight against sterotypes is almost as limiting as doing something just to fit in with them.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I do think it's concederate to keep my space clean. So maybe the ideal is too keep my space clean even thought I don't care about having it that clean? Will this induce more desire in me? How much of my own time and enjoyment should I sacrifice to make thoses around me more comftable?</div><div class="br"></div><div>In conclusion, I really don't want to be the kinda of guy when a partnet comes over and feels compeled to start cleaning. But I also don't care that much about the cleanliness of my environment. The solution is clear, I just don't wanna.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Related: <a href="#cleaning">Cleaning</a></div></div><div class="section" id="cleaning"><div class="title"><a href="#cleaning">Cleaning</a><div>11/16/2023</div></div><div>One of the challenges of living with another word for human beings, is that each will natural have a diffrent level of cleanliness they desire. For example, my current house mate, Miles, has a higher threshold for when to sweep the floor. I don't mind sweeping, but a dirty floor dosent bother him and much as it bothers me, so he always ends up sweeping before I get around to it. Last year, with my privious roommates, it was the opposite, I had higher standers for the kitchen, so I ended up cleaning more.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Just having one person clean all the time obviously isen't ideal. Luckily Miles is an awesome roommate and dosent mind. I keep on offering to do more, but he sais it's fine. But if he wasn't, that's the important of instutions. My rebudal to anarchism (as much as I love it), is who cleans?</div><div class="br"></div><div>Related: <a href="#cleanliness">Cleanliness</a></div></div><div class="section" id="power"><div class="title"><a href="#power">Freedom and Power</a><div>2/3/2023</div></div><div>"Solitude" by Ursula K. Le Guin is my favorite short story, or at the very least, the one I've spent the most time thinking about. No one else I've recomnded it to has enjoyed it as much as I have.</div><div class="br"></div><div>To me it's about the tension between freedom and power. In the story an anthropologist decends onto a planet to learn its inhabtiants. The people of this world fear power, or as they call it "magic".</div><div class="br"></div><div>Power is the ability to get other people to do what you want them to do. This includes very coercive ways (do this or I'll shoot you), but also more postive form of power, like love and frendship.</div><div class="br"></div><div>In the end she can't take it and leaves the plant, but the daugher enjoyed her time their and wishes she could go back. When I first heard the story I felt more like the daugher. I had an urge to run away and flee all the constrants that held me down too other people, but I've since changed my mind.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Power is the fundamental fabric of society, it's what makes laws, social conventions and connections between people. I think whats most important is that power is equally distributed among the people involved. If two people are in a relation ship, I think it's okay for them to have a lot of power over each other, as long as it's equal and what the both want.</div><div class="br"></div><div>As for me, I prefere relationships with little power, but still some is required.</div></div><div class="section" id="mental_disorders"><div class="title"><a href="#mental_disorders">Mental Disorders</a><div>2/3/2023</div></div><div>I personally identify as Dyslexic. I find it a usefull label for multiple reasons, by a major one is that it provides both an excuse when I forgot someones name (or do something else dumb) and an reason for them to be empethic with me.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I think this it's a shame that people need this. Their are two factors that make up a person: nature and nurture; and we don't controle either.</div><div class="br"></div><div>At their best I think mental disorders are a way society to put people in boxs to help explain their behavior to them selves and other. (not including the clincal uses, I'm not a therapist and will not comment one that aspect) This can be helpfull for people to be emethic towards themseves and others. But what if we could be maximally empathic to everyone?</div><div class="br"></div><div>Being maximally empathic to everyone carries some immediately problems: "It's okay he hates the jew. Nature and nurture, what are you gonna do *shurg*" I think their are some way to deal with theses problems will still remaining maximally empathic (ex: no longer association with people who hurt you).</div><div class="br"></div><div>But, we can't just let the worst parts of humanity grow unchallenged. Both in society and within individuals. How do you balance fighting back against negative traits against simple accepting them? I wish I knew, but I think society would be better if we tended more towards empathy, espcally for things that don't hurt other people as much.</div><div class="br"></div><div>All this to say, please be gentle with I'm certain the many spelling mistakes I haven't caught in the making of this blog. </div></div><div class="section" id="pity"><div class="title"><a href="#pity">Pity</a><div>26/2/2023</div></div><div>I was talking to Ash the other day about how we respond to random people on the street insulting us. I said that I just pity them and see their insult as them lashing out against a world that has hurt them.</div><div class="br"></div><div>In other words: I don't take them seriously. I think I do this for a lot of aspects of my life. I try to take a step back and view the situation as if I were separate from my body and just controlling it.</div><div class="br"></div><div>This helps me take things less seriously and not care so much when stuff goes bad, or even allows me to enjoy it. I just reframe it as an adventure (I can't just reframe every bad experience as an adventure. I think my brother dying would make me very sad, no matter what lens I try to apply to it).</div><div class="br"></div><div>Ash also asked me once: "Can you just choose to be happy?" I think the answer is kinda yes. It's a matter of framing. And how you choose to think about a situation.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I'm not sure how healthy it is to disconnect from reality like that. I'm not sure if I should try to disconnect more or less. Am I feeding a deep wound in my soul for surface level happiness? What if I could be happy about my brother dying? <a href="#toasim">Is this the way?</a></div><div class="br"></div><div>This got way off topic, but I think it was interesting and worthwhile. I might reconsider and split this into multiple posts.</div></div><div class="section" id="edm_rave"><div class="title"><a href="#edm_rave">EDM Rave</a><div>26/2/2023</div></div><div>Nazil from NM got me the inside tip on EDM Rave. The IG post simply said it was happening at a secret location. The secret location happened to be under a train. Everytime a train came overhead we would cheer as its thundering clanging drowned out the music.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I was dancing pretty hard, but the crowd was small and there were only a couple of us really going at it. Nazil didn't come after all, so instead I ended up talking to a electrical engineering freshman called Victor. We even walked home together since we lived in the same direction.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I don't know why, but I sometimes like to invent alternate versions of myself while talking to new people I don't ever think I'll see again. During our first brief interaction I told him I was a French exchange student and just rolled with it the rest of the night. Everything else I told him about me was basically true, with the exception of inventing a time where I slept at the Richmond bart station waiting for the first amtrak train in the morning.</div><div class="br"></div><div>This time it might back fire on me. At the end he asked for my IG and I even told him about NM so we will see what happens.</div><div class="br"></div><div>The good news, is he's a chill and interesting dude. His hobby is collection and cataloging digital music files. His specialty was rare 2010's emo music. He would find them from long forgotten website or download them from peer-to-peer file sharing systems (usually not torrent, other less well known things). He then also hosted them. Apparently he has a couple thousand albums hosted!</div></div><div class="section" id="angel_sheep"><div class="title"><a href="#angel_sheep">Angel Sheep</a><div>25/2/2023</div></div><div>Angel sheep was the second ever programming project I worked on (excluding scratch).

He takes this and chooses to work on reality. Taoism is the idea to instead adjust expectations (in part, as far as my limited understanding goes).</div><div class="br"></div><div>Taking radical acceptance to its extreme says we shouldn't try to influence reality at all. Should the oppressed try to just be happy with their position? No, that seems unconscionable to me.</div><div class="br"></div><div>So, how do you determine what to change and what to accept?

Morality is ultimately subjective, but I like people to be happy and full of love. Utilitarianism is about maximizing that. If you think that there is a different moral philosophy that is better at making people happy, then utilitarianism says we should act according to it.</div><div class="br"></div><div>The only problem is that it's, like most things, very complicated in its simplicity.

Or at least your brain has to be deterministic.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Imagine if we went backwards in time but didn't change anything and let your entire life play out again. Hopefully you would do exactly the same things as before given the same inputs.

If you replace all the parts of your bike slowly one by one over the years, when is it not the same bike? What if you build a new bike out of the old pieces of the bike?</div><div class="br"></div><div>I think the solution to this conundrum is very simple. Words and identity are imaginary. The reality of the situation is just molecules moving around. Saying 'ship' or 'my bike' are just labels we put over the infinitely complex reality. This allows us to simplify and communicate with one another, but it's important to never lose sight of the fact that words are constantly changing imperfect representations of the world.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Is water wet?

Otherwise I'll keep everything in line with my current thinking and lose a connection with my past self.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Cons:</div><div class="bullet">- I wouldn't be able to improve or update documents where that might be a good idea. For example: I want to make a post about my philosophy for charity. I feel like that is something that will change a lot in the future. I'd like to be able to keep it up to date. Similar idea for a resume.</div><div class="bullet">- What if someone points out a spelling mistake? </div><div class="br"></div><div>Here's what I'm thinking: I allow myself unlimited ability to edit withing 24 hours-ish of creating a new post. After that I can only make edits for small things that don't change the meaning or character of a post (But even that I'm uncertain about. I think my spelling mistakes can be charming and add character).

At least with imperial units there are some countries that side with us, but we are the ONLY country to primarily use m/d/y. We just had to choose the worst possible option.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I will not bend to US hegemony! This site will use day/month/year since it's both the most common globally, and it's what's used in France.</div><div class="br"></div><div>To consider: y/m/d could cause less confusion since it can't be mistaken for m/d/y, whereas d/m/y can.
