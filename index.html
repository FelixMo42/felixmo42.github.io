This makes sense to me. The second most common is year/month/day. This also make sense to me.</div><div></div><div>The US, however, use month/day/year. Why?!? At least with imperial units there as some countries that side with us. We are the ONLY country to primarily use m/d/y. We just had to choose the worst possible option.</div><div></div><div>I will not bend to US hegemony!</div><div></div><div>This site will use day/month/year since it both the most common globally, and it's what's used in France.</div><div></div><div>PS: In reaserching this I learned that year/month/day is used accross most of asia.</div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><div>Just Getting Something Done</div><div>23/2/2023</div></div><div></div><div>Everytime I think about working on this site I get caught in trying to figure out what the perfect first posts would be. I need to make sure it's not some silly small thought I have on my mind at the moment, but something meaningfull. This is very a much a perfect is the enemy of the good situation. </div><div></div><div>This post seems like a good comprimise to me. It both feels meaningfullish and makes sense as a first thing on here. Hopefull this will open the way to write more nonsense. I find this want for perfection messes with me the most for writing.</div><div></div><div>Here's to getting something done!</div></div></body></div></body></html>
