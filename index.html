And I admit, they usally don't contain much of the the thematic depth and insight into the human condition that I usally makes me love a book. But something about them is like just lights up my neurons.</div></div><div class="section" id="compassion"><div class="title"><a href="#compassion">Compassion</a><div>28/4/2023</div></div><div>Last Thursday a man named David was found dead in central park. His nickname was the "compassion guy", for his work spreading compassion and positivity around the community.</div><div class="br"></div><div>So, in honor of his life, I will awnser for my self the question he's been asking people to consider for decades, whay does compassion mean to you?</div><div class="br"></div><div>My first instinct was: Acceptance of someone despite their flaws.</div><div class="br"></div><div>This immediate issue then, is what is a flaw. Are evagelic christans compassionate if they love someone despite them being gay? I don't think so. I still think flaws can exist however. I would say any trait's that cause you to lash out and hurt people is a flaw. But determing what is a flaw, and was it a good thing you just don't understand is hard. So part of compassion I think is comming to term <a href="taosim_plus_utilitaramsim">inability to know everything.</a></div><div class="br"></div><div>So, love despite flaws, love despite hurting someone. Does that excuse and abusive partner? I think not. You can be compasionate towards someone, but still recognize their presence in your life does more harm than good and leave them.</div><div class="br"></div><div>But I still think we should make an effort to reach out to people who hurt us and be the first too descolate. But also I haven't been in an abusive sitation, so I could easily see my mind changing on this. I guess, my point here, be compassionate to thoses who sometimes don't seem compassionate is also very important.</div></div><div class="section" id="80000h_149"><div class="title"><a href="#80000h_149">80000h #149</a><div>12/4/2023</div></div><div>I want to start doing right ups after each episode of 80,000 Hours. Its a pod cast that I'm a big fan of, and they don't publish to often so I think it should be feasible. I higly recomend people check it out.</div><div class="br"></div><div>This episode was intervewing a psychologist. My favorite sections we're about CBT and stoicism. I rate the episode very highly, I think I'll be thinking about what it said for a very long time. It's 3 hours long, so I'll limit my writing to a few things, but I found almost the whole thing facinating.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Section #1, CBT:</div><div class="br"></div><div>The basic idea of CBT, as I understand it, is too apply the scientifc method to your own thoughts and impulses.</div><div class="br"></div><div>What came to mind was my advension to take up peoples attention. Ash really revealed to me the lengths I was willing to go to not message somebody. I like talking to people, this is more routed in a fear of bothering them.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Two things: telling someones emortions are basically imposible, so I should just ask people. I'm thinking starting with Eli cause I think that would be really interesting discussion and Eli is Eli. The second is to recognize the discomfort, but not let in conrolle me. Also according to this episode exposure thearapy for this kinda thing really does work. So I should register and even talk about the discofort, but not let it stop me.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Section #2, Stoicism:</div><div class="br"></div><div>Definitly a lot of complementary stuff here with my interest it Toasim, but also very diffrent.</div><div class="br"></div><div>One of the big things they talk about is Virtues.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Utilitarism is hard, we can't do all the calucation everytime. The solution I'd heard to this is think hard to come up with some good rules, then just mostly live be them. That way you have easy guidlines to act with out having to think to hard for most situations.</div><div class="br"></div><div>This episode argued that Virtures (ie: character traits) are a better way to do this. One big reason is rules feel restrictive and harm mental health, where as virtues are more positive and can be a great help to mental health. For example: I think one of the core virutes for me would be empathy. Now since I'm striving to be empithetic when someone is an asshole to me it's good since I can't practice empathy and get better at empathy.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I've definitly felt somethings like this before where I feel the joy of working to expand, and its some on the best feeling in the world. I want to cultivate this even more in me. That way hopefully even when I fail I see that as an oppertunity to get better at it and take solace and joy.</div><div class="br"></div><div>One of the privious episodes they had was about motivation and happiness as well. They talked about for making routines having positive rewards after you fail is important and one the better things that can be done for long term behavior change.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I've got a great feeling.</div><div class="br"></div><div>PS: I'm really sorry to anyone who reads this stuff. It's more of a scarch pad for my thoughts than anything really meant to be read. I'm not sure why I put this online.</div></div><div class="section" id="utopia"><div class="title"><a href="#utopia">Utopia</a><div>12/4/2023</div></div><div>PRE NOTE: I created this at some point when I was in Denver. I don't remeber when. This seemed like a good place to put it.</div><div class="br"></div><div>The world woke up this morning tired. Tired of all the limits they had put on them selves. Tired of all the work they forced each other to do. Tired of all the evil that had to be ignored.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Crowds gathered in the streets. Together they sang and danced all day. Reveling in tradtions of old, modern and invented.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Of course, there were still some things that needed to be done. Doctores and nurses still had people to take care of. But even there, they found there burden vastily reduced.</div><div class="br"></div><div>They were shocked at how empty the hospital was. There were no cars on the streets to hit people. The hungry and cold were invited in by neibors or took over empty aparments. But perhaps the most significant was the lack of stress. Few people had relized just how anxious they were, or how big of a health problem that caused.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Still, people felt for the people forced to work on such a joyous day. More and more people stremed in to help how they could. Each of the sick could got all the attention they needed.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Kids didn't go to school. Instead they roved the streets in packs, playing great games accross the city.</div><div class="br"></div><div>The world fell asleep peacfull and happy that night. Many had there first good night of sleep in years. When they awoke the next morning food was the matter of discussion.</div><div class="br"></div><div>There had been no shiping or deliveries yesterday, and no farming as all the farmers had joined the festivites. Some set to work, at there own leasure, making farms in every yard across the world. Other journed to the country side to help the farms.</div><div class="br"></div><div>The young and fit took the task of local deliveries. The biked or walked up to local farms to gather food and bring it back to the cities or other places who need it. Restaurants had all closed, but thoes who enjoyed cooking took them over. They made meals just for them selves, or in great batches to feed the public.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Doctors were suprised to see even less people show up today. They were eating healther, and living healther lives. Mental health was still a problem, but the new socal and friendly way of the world was helping more then they ever could. There were still a few drug related imisions, but not as many. Clean needles were available to all who wanted them, and people supported thoses adicted. The stigma and violence soronding them was gone. They made sure they didnt overdose and helped them get off the drugs if the wished. Others tried them for the first time in there lives.</div><div class="br"></div><div>By the end of the month food was a solved problem. People who could and wanted to helped at the local garden and farms. Many out in the middle of nowhere were abondoned to nature. The farms travaling where they pleased. Some liked where they were and small self-sufficient rural communities arose.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Students had gotten a vacation, but learning was still needed. Debates were held in the street about what this should look like. Children were encouraged to voice there input. Only one thing could be agreed open, the previous way did not work. Instread they broken up into smaller learning comunties.</div><div class="br"></div><div>The most popular way was to learn be doing. Kids would join in on various task and would be tought how to do them. It was important that there were not told what to do, but did it because they wanted too. Many who had hated school found they had a pansion for learning.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Parents found they finally had time to take care of there children. Still, a small child is hard with even two. Familes of all sorts, single parents, couples and even polycules joined togher to help each other raised the kids. The orphanges were emptied and the kids where welcomed with open arms into whatever communities they wished.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Still, there was one problem, infrastucture. The small stuff was allright. People enjoyed tinkering, mechanics or building things where taught by thoses who know how. Whenever a cabinate, window, or furnace broke there were allways people happy to help fix it.</div><div class="br"></div><div>The problem were roads, the electic grid and water. Luckily the need for theses had been drastically reduced. Cars had mostly been abolshed.</div><div class="br"></div><div>All available solar panals had been put to use. Most industry had been stoped. People find they didnt really need all the junk that was bein made. Transportaion was much less need. Most of intenet lay abandond. The parts used for comunication and entertainment were stiped of the ads, tracking and algorythims. With out these, humanity had cut it power consumtion by more than half.</div><div class="br"></div><div>For local garndens and farms people used gray water from there houses. They also set up barels to collect from the roofs. Again water use was more than halfed globally.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Still, there was some need for theses public utilities. Some, were considered to much work to maintain. Power lines running throught distant forest, coal plants and gas plants were shut down. Ones in cities or populated areas were taken care of by its denizines. For thoses father away occasional travel groups would be orgonized to inspect and repair them. Many found a love for this sort of traval life style and were welcomed with warmless and well fed whereever they went.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Even with the drastically reduced consumption, goods started to run out. Factories had been abandoned, but even it they weren't, global shipping had stoped. There were still many avid pilots and captains who were happy transport the truly essential items that couldnt be made locally. People flocked around the factories that were still open and start producing what was needed.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Even once the world had found it self in a stable state, people had unpresedented amount of leasure time. The science and arts flurished. People who had wanted to try their hand at either, finally got the opportunity. Thoses allredy expirenced got the reasorces and freedom to let out their creativty and ingenuity. High cost blockbusters became much rarer, but they weren't much missed.</div></div><div class="section" id="i_cried_some_today"><div class="title"><a href="#i_cried_some_today">I Cried Some Today</a><div>11/4/2023</div></div><div>I cried some today.</div></div><div class="section" id="taosim_plus_utilitaramsim"><div class="title"><a href="#taosim_plus_utilitaramsim">Taosim + Utilitaramsim</a><div>^12/4/2023</div></div><div>[Still a draft!]</div><div class="br"></div><div>Taosim is in a sense a refusal to do the utilitarian calculus.

One of tenents of Taosim is that everybad thing is actually good. Ie: Allways a silver lining, but brough to it's extreme. Something along the line of beliving god always has a plan. Beliving everything the happens is ultimitly for the better. This used to annoy me a lot when people did this, cause obviously some outcomes are better than other, but I've since come to respect acting as if that's not true.</div><div class="br"></div><div>"Or, more charitably, have the humility to realize we lack the knowledge to ever make them in the first place."

Stressing over cleaning this up is a stress factor on my life, if I didn't care about finishing it I would be happyier. I stress over finishing it beacause I think that would lead to better outcomes in the future. But I don't know that for a fact. Most likely there will be no outcome. There a possibility that some one will think less of me for not finishing this, but also the possibility that someone will find me not finishing charming.

(Ashs orage pants + summer hat + corduroy jacket).</div><div class="bullet">- I heared a homeless guy talking about chat gtp in a very exited very british accent.</div><div class="bullet">- I saw some where a backpacking backpack on a tiny electric bike playing a ukulele or some similar instrument.</div><div class="bullet">- Ash and I had a good time sorting and packing up upper crust. Pushing the big noise plater of bread to the freedge is my favorite part.</div><div class="bullet">- While I was doing the co-ho pick up on campus I just happened to run into Eli and we had a damn good conversation.</div><div class="bullet">- How To with John Wilson is fantastic. I saw episode 2-6 of season 2.</div><div class="bullet">- Ash sent me a very sweet message.</div><div class="bullet">- I watched the first episode of season three of survivor with Miles and Eli. We again had a great conversation.</div><div class="bullet">- I got excelent advice of how to harness creativity by James Drips (A man with a fantastic name, and even better dog (with an even better name, Gater)). He recomended writing for 1 hour every monday even if you just write "i'm bored" the whole time. I'll try doing 30 an hour every day.</div><div class="bullet">- I asked damn good questions at NM. There was a huge line for the chipotle food. I asked most people about their dreams. Lots of good awnsers. One of them told me about a journaling club they do. Sounds like a very fun idea. Conclusion: I should ask people more interesting questions.</div><div class="bullet">- I saw someone riding a vespa.</div><div class="bullet">- I walked home dancing and singing along to Santiago. At the interesection befor the tunel some guys in a pickup started chearing for me.</div><div class="bullet">- I thought about my failing today, wished I had picked up more garbage, then saw a plastic bag and proceded to pick up some grabage.</div><div class="bullet">- Due to inperation of Mr. Drips + Journal club guy I'm writing this now.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Bonus thing: Didn't happened today, but it still bring my joy when I think about it. I saw <a href="https://apnews.com/article/light-streaks-california-space-debris-8eb4255b48ad7eabb6b09ec4cfb0a170">deorbiting space debris</a> a couple of fridays ago. It was one of the most magical things I've ever scene. The next day on a trash pick up sponsored by a blunt company with Ash and Maggie I saw a coyote. 10/10 weekend.</div></div><div class="section" id="reflecting_on_respecting_some_boundaries"><div class="title"><a href="#reflecting_on_respecting_some_boundaries">Reflecting on Respecting some Boundaries</a><div>16/3/2023</div></div><div>Ash said they wanted some space after my mom came over. I wounder why? I said I wouldn't reach out of them so I will not do that. Instead I'll put my thoughs here and hope they read it I guess.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I really want to talk to them. I have to yet reach perfect Toaist enligtenment. I can see why monks are celibate. Its hard to clear desire out of your heart if you derive so much happiness being with someone.</div><div class="br"></div><div>This is effecting me more than I thought it would. I keep on flicking over to discord to see if they have messaged me or wanting to message them and reconsidering. Ash, I love you.

I'm doing that right now for your thoughts page.</div><div class="br"></div><div>If you're reading this, don't blame you're self. I think you might be right to do this. It's not healthy to be too codependent on each other.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Some things to consider in the future after this: I enjoy getting messages from Ash even if I don't have the time or energy to respond at the moment.

I'm of two minds when it comes to this.</div><div class="br"></div><div>On one hand I belive the key to happiness is having low standards. Not caring allows me to be fine in more situations and gives me more flexibility. It also gives me more more time to do other things in my limited life that I'd rather be doing than cleaning.</div><div class="br"></div><div>On the other, I kinda hate how this fit's into standard male stereotypes. But I don't think this is a very good reason. Doing something just to fight against sterotypes is almost as limiting as doing something just to fit in with them.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I do think it's concederate to keep my space clean. So maybe the ideal is too keep my space clean even thought I don't care about having it that clean? Will this induce more desire in me? How much of my own time and enjoyment should I sacrifice to make thoses around me more comftable?</div><div class="br"></div><div>In conclusion, I really don't want to be the kinda of guy when a partnet comes over and feels compeled to start cleaning. But I also don't care that much about the cleanliness of my environment.

For example, my current house mate, Miles, has a higher threshold for when to sweep the floor. I don't mind sweeping, but a dirty floor dosent bother him and much as it bothers me, so he always ends up sweeping before I get around to it. Last year, with my privious roommates, it was the opposite, I had higher standers for the kitchen, so I ended up cleaning more.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Just having one person clean all the time obviously isen't ideal. Luckily Miles is an awesome roommate and dosent mind. I keep on offering to do more, but he sais it's fine. But if he wasn't, that's the important of instutions.

No one else I've recomnded it to has enjoyed it as much as I have.</div><div class="br"></div><div>To me it's about the tension between freedom and power. In the story an anthropologist decends onto a planet to learn its inhabtiants. The people of this world fear power, or as they call it "magic".</div><div class="br"></div><div>Power is the ability to get other people to do what you want them to do.

I think whats most important is that power is equally distributed among the people involved.

Their are two factors that make up a person: nature and nurture; and we don't controle either.</div><div class="br"></div><div>At their best I think mental disorders are a way society to put people in boxs to help explain their behavior to them selves and other. (not including the clincal uses, I'm not a therapist and will not comment one that aspect) This can be helpfull for people to be emethic towards themseves and others.

Nature and nurture, what are you gonna do *shurg*" I think their are some way to deal with theses problems will still remaining maximally empathic (ex: no longer association with people who hurt you).</div><div class="br"></div><div>But, we can't just let the worst parts of humanity grow unchallenged.

I think I do this for a lot of aspects of my life. I try to take a step back and view the situation as if I were separate from my body and just controlling it.</div><div class="br"></div><div>This helps me take things less seriously and not care so much when stuff goes bad, or even allows me to enjoy it.

I'm not sure if I should try to disconnect more or less. Am I feeding a deep wound in my soul for surface level happiness? What if I could be happy about my brother dying? <a href="#toasim">Is this the way?</a></div><div class="br"></div><div>This got way off topic, but I think it was interesting and worthwhile.

The IG post simply said it was happening at a secret location. The secret location happened to be under a train. Everytime a train came overhead we would cheer as its thundering clanging drowned out the music.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I was dancing pretty hard, but the crowd was small and there were only a couple of us really going at it. Nazil didn't come after all, so instead I ended up talking to a electrical engineering freshman called Victor. We even walked home together since we lived in the same direction.</div><div class="br"></div><div>I don't know why, but I sometimes like to invent alternate versions of myself while talking to new people I don't ever think I'll see again. During our first brief interaction I told him I was a French exchange student and just rolled with it the rest of the night. Everything else I told him about me was basically true, with the exception of inventing a time where I slept at the Richmond bart station waiting for the first amtrak train in the morning.</div><div class="br"></div><div>This time it might back fire on me. At the end he asked for my IG and I even told him about NM so we will see what happens.</div><div class="br"></div><div>The good news, is he's a chill and interesting dude. His hobby is collection and cataloging digital music files. His specialty was rare 2010's emo music. He would find them from long forgotten website or download them from peer-to-peer file sharing systems (usually not torrent, other less well known things). He then also hosted them. Apparently he has a couple thousand albums hosted!</div></div><div class="section" id="angel_sheep"><div class="title"><a href="#angel_sheep">Angel Sheep</a><div>25/2/2023</div></div><div>Angel sheep was the second ever programming project I worked on (excluding scratch).

The righteous fury at the oil barons who burn the world to add a couple extra zeros to their obscene bank accounts. The self-defensive hatred for those who hate you.

He takes this and chooses to work on reality. Taoism is the idea to instead adjust expectations (in part, as far as my limited understanding goes).</div><div class="br"></div><div>Taking radical acceptance to its extreme says we shouldn't try to influence reality at all. Should the oppressed try to just be happy with their position? No, that seems unconscionable to me.</div><div class="br"></div><div>So, how do you determine what to change and what to accept?

Morality is ultimately subjective, but I like people to be happy and full of love. Utilitarianism is about maximizing that. If you think that there is a different moral philosophy that is better at making people happy, then utilitarianism says we should act according to it.</div><div class="br"></div><div>The only problem is that it's, like most things, very complicated in its simplicity.

What if you build a new bike out of the old pieces of the bike?</div><div class="br"></div><div>I think the solution to this conundrum is very simple. Words and identity are imaginary. The reality of the situation is just molecules moving around. Saying 'ship' or 'my bike' are just labels we put over the infinitely complex reality. This allows us to simplify and communicate with one another, but it's important to never lose sight of the fact that words are constantly changing imperfect representations of the world.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Is water wet?

I don't want to keep on revisiting it forever.</div><div class="bullet">- It forces me to keep the past around if I don't edit. Otherwise I'll keep everything in line with my current thinking and lose a connection with my past self.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Cons:</div><div class="bullet">- I wouldn't be able to improve or update documents where that might be a good idea. For example: I want to make a post about my philosophy for charity. I feel like that is something that will change a lot in the future. I'd like to be able to keep it up to date. Similar idea for a resume.</div><div class="bullet">- What if someone points out a spelling mistake? </div><div class="br"></div><div>Here's what I'm thinking: I allow myself unlimited ability to edit withing 24 hours-ish of creating a new post. After that I can only make edits for small things that don't change the meaning or character of a post (But even that I'm uncertain about. I think my spelling mistakes can be charming and add character). If I want to make big changes/updates I'll implements a versioning system to make it easy to go back and see previous iterations.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Luckily, I'm using <a href="https://github.com/FelixMo42/felixmo42.github.io">github for this blog</a>, so if I or someone else really want's to know the dates they can dig through the commit history.</div><div class="br"></div><div>If I change my mind I'll come back and edit this post.

This site will use day/month/year since it's both the most common globally, and it's what's used in France.</div><div class="br"></div><div>To consider: y/m/d could cause less confusion since it can't be mistaken for m/d/y, whereas d/m/y can.
