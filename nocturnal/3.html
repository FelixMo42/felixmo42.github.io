It’s allowed us to have lights every night this week, and four out of five days have even managed to turn into impromptu dance nights.</div><div class="br"></div><div>This food has also been flowing abundantly. A UC Davic dietary study gave us their left over bags of frozen meals that they used to ensure consistency. Four hundred pounds in total!</div><div class="br"></div><div>The farmers market was also plentiful.  It’s prime cherry season, and the number of boxes we were given reflect that. For next week we definitely need to bring a cart. Bags to make sure the juices don’t get everywhere would probably be a good idea as well.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Dining commons is gonna be back for the summer!  The Food Recovery Network, a student organization, used to pick up Dining commons food on  Mondays and Fridays, but will not be switching over to Thursdays. There will also be a reduced quantity due to only one dining hall being open.</div><div class="br"></div><div>Till next week night marketers!</div></div></div></div></body></html>
