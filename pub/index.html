<h1>Felix Moses</h1>

<p>I'm a software developer, EMT, and mutual aid coordinator with a passion for interesting people, puzzles, travel, and making the world a better place! I'm looking to live my life to the fullest and to set my self up in a career focused around systemic change.</p>

<p>My current quest is traveling the world sans plane; Trains, boats and buses abound! I love reading, playing cards, moral philosophy, cooking, nature and dancing.</p>

<p>I grew up mostly in Berkeley, and have lived some in San Francisco, Bethesda, Denver, Davis and Paris.</p>
