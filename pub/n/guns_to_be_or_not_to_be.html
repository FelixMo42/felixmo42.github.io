Given that, there are three common arguments for the existence: <a href="./i_need_a_gun_for_protection.html">I need a gun for protection</a>, <a href="./i_need_a_gun_to_hunt.html">I need a gun to hunt</a>, and <a href="./guns_are_fun.html">Guns are fun</a>. Along with that there is the broader universal argument that <a href="./freedom_mean_you_cant_tell_me_what_to_do.html">Freedom mean you can't tell me what to do</a>.</p><p></p><p>The argument against is simple: Guns kill people and that is bad. Even if we want them only for non-murder uses, we run into a case of <a href="./a_real_life_chekhovs_gun.html">A real life Chekhov's gun</a>. Tools to kill will inevitable be used as they were intended. It would be better to simply not have them.</p><p></p><p>Of course the process of uninventing the gun will not be an easy one. This is a <a href="./utopia.html">utopian</a> argument, that is too say for a far off distant future. Since guns are the archetypical example of an <a href="./arms_race.html">Arms race</a>, all the usual difficulties of Deescalation exist here as well, both in nation to nation sense, as well as an individual to individual sense.</p><p></p><p>Note: The discussion on Gun Control in a modern context is a different but related question, one much more empirical and therefore messy.</p><p></p></main></body></html>
