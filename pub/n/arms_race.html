The classical example is with militaries. If you make you're military bigger, I have to make mine bigger so that I don't get conquered. And now you're feeling threatened so you make yours even bigger and on and on we get until the soviet union collapsed or WW1 starts.</p><p></p><p>As David Graeber argues in Bullshit Jobs, arms races can apply more generally to a vast array or parts of society, and in end up in tremendous amounts of wasted energy and potential. Examples include: advertising, corporate lawyers and lobbying. That's not to say none of these jobs have a core of utility, but simply that they scale in proportion to how much competitors are spending on them.</p><p></p></main></body></html>
