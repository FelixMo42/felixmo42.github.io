If you’ve never been, I highly recommend it.  It’s a winding city of brightly painted multicolor log cabins nestled between great northern oak forests and the ice choked waters of the arctic.</p><p></p><p>The great Elder Silla himself came to greet me as I stepped off the blimp. He's the closest thing the area had to a leader. When someone shows up, like me, demanding to talk to the person in charge, we're pointed his way.  At 7 feet tall, with a beard to match, a booming voice, a huge appetite, and even at 90, a tremendous capacity for alcohol, anyone else would have felt wrong in comparison.</p><p></p><p>He led me towards a grand old brick building that had once been the district parliament for the colonial government.  Now, it's the home of one of the last three firearm factories in the world. Already contracts had been signed with the other two agreeing to shut down if all the others did so as well. This was the last hold out. But that wasn't the only reason this place is special. Somewhere up further north, kept cold by the eternal ice, is one of the largest data stores in the world. Vast reams of data tapes along with computing infrastructure needed to record new info and send it back out into the world to curious readers. My hope was to get them no only to agree to shut down the factory, but also remove all knowledge of how to even create firearms in the first place.</p><p></p><p>I'm here as an official representative for the PWW. The group was started by a radical splinter of an old nuclear deescalation group from back when that was a relevant thing to be. The founders had been committed to the principle of a world free of weapons and violence.  In the decades since we've lost our hatred of swords and bows, along with the religious undertones, but have continued to work towards the complete removal of guns from society.</p><p></p><p>As we approached the sound of gun fire from the nearby shooting range got louder and louder. It was the last day of the yearly gun festival. Kids ran back and forth around from tent to tent, carrying the flags of the liberation army that had freed this land from the forces that once oppressed it.</p><p></p><p>I could see all manner of tactics to stack the deck ever so slightly in my favor. I thought about waiting to have the town hall after the inevitable next time something tragic happens; perhaps a two year old accidentally shooting a parent, or a depressed teen blowing their brains out, or even the mundane abuser shooting their partner. But, I rejected all these, instead selecting to come right when positive sentiments would be at their highest. There had been of course some small injuries this year at the festival, but as I could see by the laughter around me, in general, everyone was having a great time.</p><p></p><p>In a way that's what this was all about. People were always trying to battle it out over all sorts of things. Arms races always leave victims. I would not engage in these strategies. Mine was a message of peace and I would have to use tactics of peace.</p><p></p><p>Many of my coworkers in the PWW joined out of some deep personal conviction born from unspeakable violence committed against them or the people they love. As for me, I'd always been temperamentally a pacifist with a desire to do good in some general undefined sense. I'd followed a love interest of mine into the world of conflict resolution, then after he made it clear it wouldn't work out between the two of us I felt the need to travel. One of my mentors used to work for the PWW and told me they were looking for a gun conflict resolution mentor, starting my long and occasionally fruitful time with the PWW.</p><p></p><p>The culture of the village was a mix of Inuit and rugged homesteaders, so completely mixed throughout the centuries had turned into its own unique concoction. But, one thing that both sides had in common was a love of guns. Guns for huntings. Guns for sports. Guns for defense. Guns for righteous liberation. But, to my eyes they always forgot the guns used to oppress. The guns that had once genocide their ancestors. The guns of those who they defended themselves against. People tended to love their guns, and hated those of the other. Personally I don't find it so easy to separate the two.</p><p></p><p>*(something more of the festival, establish some of the characters for the town hall)*</p><p></p><p>After the festival we went back to the county estate, a huge building that served as community space, hotel, administrative building and most else that they needed. In the main hall hung the taxidermied head of an elk. I stood frozen for a moment staring into its pain filled eyes, then Silla called my name and I hurried after him into the dinning room.</p><p></p><p>For dinner were thick slices of marbled Muskox steaks, hunted at today's competition. After the Elk I felt a little uncomfortable eating it, but soon gave in to its juicy aroma. In addition, they used every part of the body: a hide jacket for the winner, stews and sausages of the guts, jewelry out the the bones, and innumerable other small trinkets to be used as various prizes and gifts.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, after a hearty breakfast of black coffee and Muskox porridge, I was led to the meeting room that would be used for the town hall. Elder Silla sat with me on a short stage. I looked across the room. It was an eclectic collection of local citizens, some chosen to represent groups, others independently very passionate on the issue, and some with nothing better to do today. In all about 100 people.</p><p></p><p>Elder Silla is the first to speak. "First, I thank you all for coming today. When the vote comes I still don't know which way I will go, but know this, to me the most important thing is the safety and security of the citizens of our home. To that end my commitment knows no limits."</p><p></p><p>Elder Yaari steps up to the microphone. She’s old, with tanned leather for skin and eyes that burn like the desert sun. She turns to look directly at Silla and I. "Mayor Silla, I appreciate your concern over our community, but, with all do respect, you have never seen the real face of war, only heard the story of glory from our parents. I too was fooled by them once, but unlike you I was stupid enough to act on my beliefs. I went and killed in the name of solidarity against the last of the tyrants of the old world, holding desperately to their power."</p><p></p><p>I look at Silla. He’s shifting in his seat.</p><p></p><p>She continues. "Our current peace may have been won in part by gunpowder and steel, but that is not what holds it together. Europe spent centuries killing each other, it was only the EU that ended it. The buildup of weapons always leads to war. A gun once made will be used, this rule has been proved time and time again, let's not be foolish enough to test history. The armies of the last century have been melted down and turned into houses and hospitals. Let them stay that way."</p><p></p><p>She bowes and steps off stage.  </p><p></p><p>Next is Oriel, a slender bespectacled man. "In principle I agree with Elder Silla. I wish I could get rid of my guns, but I don't feel safe doing so, not until I know my children and I will be safe."</p><p></p><p>I stand up to answer this one. "I fully understand. As I'm sure all of you know, the PWW has partnered with the UN to provide a gun buyback program." There's a chuckle throughout the room. They're well acquainted with it. "Currently we are unwilling to put much money into it since it can act as a subsidy to gun owners. But, we have already secured the funds to increase the pay out by at least 10 fold, perhaps more."</p><p></p><p>Ivan K sauter's up. "You think you can bribe us into your little new world order. I may not be a historian like our dear Oswald, but I've read those old dusty books too. Once the people are defenseless that when governments become tyrannical. The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. I'm never gonna give you my damn guns, you're gonna have to pry them from my cold dead hands"</p><p></p><p>Oriel: "Fuck you Ivan. I hope you keel over soon, cause once you do I'm gonna go sell my guns and go buy the kids all the presents you were drunk to buy."</p><p></p><p>Ivan K yelled after Oriel as she heads back to her seat. "Don't be so fast honey, you may think I'm the worst demon this world has to offer, but I assure you, there's so much worse."</p><p></p><p>The paradox of tolerance. I was gonna have to either get Ivan K to calm down or kick him out of the hall. This was always my least favorite part of this kinda thing. It bothers me sometimes that we let people like him vote, even if I know the alternative is much worse. The thought that he could get in the way of a better world for billions seemed unconscionable.</p><p></p><p>Devin steps up. "Look, I may not like Ivan K, but he's got some good points. And what next after guns? Crossbows? Huntings knives? And sure, I may not go out of my way to go build my own guns, but someone will, and as he said, there are worse demons than him out there. Just last year down in Sedita that had that sailor who just snapped and shot a bunch of people."</p><p></p><p>I recognize the next speaker. Ulu. She’s a regular at disarmament conferences. She's the founder of a company that sells tasers and other non-lethal weapons. "I agree - humans have always fought, but guns are not the only choice. I think we need to pair this move with a greater investment in defense and non lethal weapons technology. That way, when we have our next serial killer, or (with a look at Oriel), a deranged partner, we can still defend ourselves."</p><p></p><p>Ulu continues. "In addition, as a community, I think we should consider re-establishing a military, this time entirely armed with alternative weapons technologies."</p><p></p><p>I stand up. "And I think we might be forgetting the other half of the agreement. The idea is not only to shut down the factory, but also to remove as much of the info on the creation of guns as possible from the world. The reason is to set back any bad actors."</p><p></p><p>Devin responds. "This is clearly a step too far. We're sounding like book burners. Knowledge isn't dangerous, it's what we do with it. And even if every major repository wipes themselves clean, it still won't get rid of the info. People all over have all that stuff downloaded on their personal computers, hell, I have it downloaded, just in case it does get deleted. Don't you see, its pointless. You can't rewind time."</p><p></p><p>Oriel says exactly what I want to say. "Sure, the info is gonna be out there, and probably always will, but that doesn't mean we have to make it easy. This is a game of probabilities, not of absolutes. Each step we take to make it harder for the next scumbag wanna be murderer, the less likely they are to do it. And maybe instead they'll use a knife, or whatever else, but that still makes it harder."</p><p></p><p>Carlos, a nervous man from the back comes up. It’s clear he’s been waiting his turn. "I agree. My son shot himself 6 years ago now. He'd read up all about the deadliest ways to commit suicided. I never allowed guns in the house, but he managed to download schematics to the home 3d printer and just made his own. Getting his hands on bullets was easy. It still took him a while to, but one day. And we could have saved him otherwise."</p><p></p><p>Mika is the only one either brave or stupid enough to fill the silence that follows. "I'm sorry about your son, man, but like, we can't impinge on people's freedoms. And for me, hunting is a part of life. I don't want to be forced into the ways of you city folk. Off grid all day everyday."</p><p></p><p>I stand up. "Alright folks, looks like that's all the time we have for today."</p><p></p><p>I head to my room, exhausted. There is still much work to be done, but, for now, I rest.</p><p></p><p>THE END</p><p></p><p>(The ending sucks. It just kinda stops. And in general the pacing is not there yet)</p><p></p><p>(One thing I like about Ted Chiang is there is always a small more human analogy to the big idea. Here I think that would be interpersonal conflict and how that can be made worse/better or something. The story has a little of that, but it needs to be more deeply integrated, and pay off in the end of the story. Not quite sure how yet.)</p><p></p><p>(On the plus side, I think I have all the grand scale ideas down decently. It definitely needs some sorting and rewriting to make it flow better, but the core is there I think.)</p><p></p></main></body></html>
