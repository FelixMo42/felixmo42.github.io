Thar be events on the horizon! This week we’ve got the 4th of July (fireworks will be visible from NM) and a community  meeting on wednesday.

# Blunessence

Bluessence is a women led dreampop band that's gonna come play at Night Market on the 13th. Here’s a sample of their music: https://youtu.be/JeSYx7Ps0E4.

The only issue is that we don’t have outlets available, so we need a battery pack or something similar for the bassist. They also requested a PA system with a microphone is possible. We will see what we can do! Please reach out if you can help.

# Other Event Ideas

But, theres a lot more events we’d like to do!

Here are some ideas: an art night, game night or music night.
