I was talking to Ash the other day about how we respond to random people on the street insulting us. I said that I just pity them and see their insult as them lashing out against a world that has hurt them.

In other words: I don't take them seriously. I think I do this for a lot of aspects of my life. I try to take a step back and view the situation as if I were separate from my body and just controlling it.

This helps me take things less seriously and not care so much when stuff goes bad, or even allows me to enjoy it. I just reframe it as an adventure (I can't just reframe every bad experience as an adventure. I think my brother dying would make me very sad, no matter what lens I try to apply to it).

Ash also asked me once: "Can you just choose to be happy?" I think the answer is kinda yes. It's a matter of framing. And how you choose to think about a situation.

I'm not sure how healthy it is to disconnect from reality like that. I'm not sure if I should try to disconnect more or less. Am I feeding a deep wound in my soul for surface level happiness? What if I could be happy about my brother dying? <a href="#toasim">Is this the way?</a>

This got way off topic, but I think it was interesting and worthwhile. I might reconsider and split this into multiple posts.
