        Most of the world use day/month/year for their dates. This makes sense to me. The second most common is year/month/day. This also make sense, but is a little less familiar to me.

        The US in the ONLY country in the world to use month/day/year as the most common format. Why?!? At least with imperial units there as some countries that side with us. We just had to choose the worst possible option. I will not bend to US hegemony.

        I'm gonna use day/month/year since it both the most common globally, and it's what's used in France.
