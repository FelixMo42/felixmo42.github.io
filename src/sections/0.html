        Everytime I think about working on this site I get caught in trying to figure out what the perfect first posts would be. I need to make sure it's not some silly small thought I have on my mind at the moment, but something meaningfull. This is very a much a perfect is the enemy of the good situation.

        The idea that most offten that comes to mind is what I want to this site to be/the tech I'm working on to make it work. Only two issues: I don't want to write about that and I don't know what this site will turn into.

        This post seems like a good comprimise to me. It both feels meaningfullish and makes sense as a first thing on here. Hopefull this will open the way to write more nonsense. I find this want for perfection messes with me the most for writing.
