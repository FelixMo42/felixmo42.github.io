Most of the world use day/month/year for their dates. This makes sense to me. The second most common is year/month/day. This also make sense to me.

The US, however, use month/day/year. This does not make sense to me. At least with imperial units there as some countries that side with us, but we are the ONLY country to primarily use m/d/y. We just had to choose the worst possible option.

I will not bend to US hegemony! This site will use day/month/year since it both the most common globally, and it's what's used in France.

PS: In reaserching this I learned that year/month/day is used accross most of asia.
