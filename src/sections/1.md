!title How to Order a Date?
!created 23/2/2023

Most of the world uses day/month/year for their dates. This makes sense to me. The second most common is year/month/day. This also makes sense to me.

The US, however, uses month/day/year. This does not make sense to me. At least with imperial units there are some countries that side with us, but we are the ONLY country to primarily use m/d/y. We just had to choose the worst possible option.

I will not bend to US hegemony! This site will use day/month/year since it's both the most common globally, and it's what's used in France.

To consider: y/m/d could cause less confusion since it can't be mistaken for m/d/y, whereas d/m/y can. In researching this I learned that y/m/d is almost exclusively used across most of asia. By preferring d/m/y am I just being eurocentric?
