I hate anger. It's by far my least favorite emotion to feel.

But I do get it in some cases. The righteous fury at the oil barons who burn the world to add a couple extra zeros to their obsene bank accounts. The self-defensive hatred for thoses who hate you. An all encompasing rage at how much needless pain we allow to exist.

If these emotions are what you need to keep on moving, to make the world a better place, to live then I see the value in it. But I can't help but to think that it dosen't lead to the best places. An eye for an eye leaves the world blind.
