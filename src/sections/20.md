Ash said they wanted some space after my mom came over. I wounder why? I said I wouldn't reach out of them so I will not do that. Instead I'll put my thoughs here and hope they read it I guess.

I really want to talk to them. I have to yet reach perfect Toaist enligtenment. I can see why monks are celibate. Its hard to clear desire out of your heart if you derive so much happiness being with someone.

This is effecting me more than I thought it would. I keep on flicking over to discord to see if they have messaged me or wanting to message them and reconsidering. Ash, I love you. I hope you want to reconnect soon.

Do you ever reload this page over and over again hoping I've posted something new? I'm doing that right now for your thoughts page.

Some things to consider in the future after this: I enjoy getting messages from Ash even if I don't have the time or energy to respond at the moment. Do they feel the same?
