"It dwells in (the lowly) places that all disdain -
    Wherein it comes near to the Tao."
- Lin Yutang translation of The Tao Te Ching, section 8, water

I have very low standards for cleanliness. I'm of two minds when it comes to this.

On one hand I belive the key to happiness is having low standards. Not caring allows me to be fine in more situations and gives me more flexibility. It also gives me more more time to do other things in my limited life that I'd rather be doing than cleaning.

On the other, I kinda hate how this fit's into standard male stereotypes. But I don't think this is a very good reason. Doing something just to fight against sterotypes is almost as limiting as doing something just to fit in with them.

I do think it's concederate to keep my space clean. So maybe the ideal is too keep my space clean even thought I don't care about having it that clean? Will this induce more desire in me? How much of my own time and enjoyment should I sacrifice to make thoses around me more comftable?

In conclusion, I really don't want to be the kinda of guy when a partnet comes over and feels compeled to start cleaning. But I also don't care that much about the cleanliness of my environment. The solution is clear, I just don't wanna.
