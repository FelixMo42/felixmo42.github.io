Do we have free will?

Many people frame this issue as do we live in deterministic reality or do we have free will. I couldn't disagree more. I think to have free will we must live in deterministic reality. Or at least your brain has to be deterministic.

Imagine if we went backwards in time but didn't change anything and let your entire life play out again. Hopefully you would do exactly the same things as before given the same inputs. The alternative is your actions are random and free will is impossible.

Note: I'm not actually saying we have free will. To do that I would need to know what free will <a href="#ship_of_theseus">means to you</a>.

"If you could somehow examine a multitude of Martin Luthers across many worlds, I think you'd have to go far afield to find one that didn't defy the church, and that would say something about the kind of person he was."
