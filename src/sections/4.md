For the uninitiated: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">The Ship of Theseus</a> is a thought experiment about whether an object which has had all of its original components replaced remains the same object. If you replace all the parts of your bike slowly one by one over the years, when is it not the same bike? What if you build a new bike out of the old pieces of the bike?

I think the solution to this conundrum is very simple. Words and identity are imaginary. The reality of the situation is just molecules moving around. Saying 'ship' or 'my bike' are just labels we put over the infinitely complex reality. This allows us to simplify and communicate with one another, but it's important to never lose sight of the fact that words are constantly changing imperfect representations of the world.

Is water wet? Who cares. Let's agree on a definition and get back to cooking or whatever we were doing before this topic came up.
