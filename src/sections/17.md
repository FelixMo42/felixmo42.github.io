"Solitude" by Ursula K. Le Guin is my favorite short story, or at the very least, the one I've spent the most time thinking about. No one else I've recomnded it to has enjoyed it as much as I have.

To me it's about the tension between freedom and power. In the story an anthropologist decends onto a planet to learn its inhabtiants. The people of this world fear power, or as they call it "magic".

Power is the ability to get other people to do what you want them to do. This includes very coercive ways (do this or I'll shoot you), but also more postive form of power, like love and frendship.

In the end she can't take it and leaves the plant, but the daugher enjoyed her time their and wishes she could go back. When I first heard the story I felt more like the daugher. I had an urge to run away and flee all the constrants that held me down too other people, but I've since changed my mind.

Power is the fundamental fabric of society, it's what makes laws, social conventions and connections between people. I think whats most important is that power is equally distributed among the people involved. If two people are in a relation ship, I think it's okay for them to have a lot of power over each other, as long as it's equal and what the both want.

As for me, I prefere relationships with little power, but still some is required.
