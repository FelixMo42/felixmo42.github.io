"I believe if there's any kind of God it wouldn't be in any of us, not you or me but just this little space in between. If there's any kind of magic in this world it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something. I know, it's almost impossible to succeed but who cares really? The answer must be in the attempt."
- Julie Delpy, Before Sunrise

I'm not at all a spirital person, but instead I put my faith, love and interest in other people. I'm fascinated by how other people think. I wish I could crawl in peoples head and see how they view the world. I supect the lens people use and the way people think about the world differ more than most would suspect, even among similar people.
