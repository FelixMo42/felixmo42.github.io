One of the challenges of living with another word for human beings, is that each will natural have a diffrent level of cleanliness they desire. For example, my current house mate, Miles, has a higher threshold for when to sweep the floor. I don't mind sweeping, but a dirty floor dosent bother him and much as it bothers me, so he always ends up sweeping before I get around to it. Last year, with my privious roommates, it was the opposite, I had higher standers for the kitchen, so I ended up cleaning more.

Just having one person clean all the time obviously isen't ideal. Luckily Miles is an awesome roommate and dosent mind. I keep on offering to do more, but he sais it's fine. But if he wasn't, that's the important of instutions. My rebudal to anarchism (as much as I love it), is who cleans?
