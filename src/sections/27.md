Last Thursday a man named David was found dead in central park. His nickname was the "compassion guy", for his work spreading compassion and positivity around the community.

So, in honor of his life, I will awnser for my self the question he's been asking people to consider for decades, whay does compassion mean to you?

My first instinct was: Acceptance of someone despite their flaws.

This immediate issue then, is what is a flaw. Are evagelic christans compassionate if they love someone despite them being gay? I don't think so. I still think flaws can exist however. I would say any trait's that cause you to lash out and hurt people is a flaw. But determing what is a flaw, and was it a good thing you just don't understand is hard. So part of compassion I think is comming to term <a href="taosim_plus_utilitaramsim">inability to know everything.</a>

So, love despite flaws, love despite hurting someone. Does that excuse and abusive partner? I think not. You can be compasionate towards someone, but still recognize their presence in your life does more harm than good and leave them.

But I still think we should make an effort to reach out to people who hurt us and be the first too descolate. But also I haven't been in an abusive sitation, so I could easily see my mind changing on this. I guess, my point here, be compassionate to thoses who sometimes don't seem compassionate is also very important.
