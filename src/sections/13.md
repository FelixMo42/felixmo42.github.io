Angel sheep was the second ever programing project I worked on (excluding scratch). Sadly project number one has been long lost to time since I didn't know how to use git back then.

It's a simple platformer with art made by a friend of mine. There even music included in the one commit I ever made to github, but it dosent seem to have ever made it into the game. My bad Maxime.

It was made using love2d. It's a great 2d game engine using lua and a higlyrecomend it to anyone look for that sort of thing.

All thing considered, its pretty damn cool for something I made in middle school.
