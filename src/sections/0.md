!title Just Get Something Done
!created 23/2/2023

Everytime I think about working on this site I get caught in trying to figure out what the perfect first posts would be. I need to make sure it's not some silly small thought I have on my mind at the moment, but something meaningfull. This is very a much a perfect is the enemy of the good situation. 

This post seems like a good comprimise to me. It both feels meaningfullish and makes sense as a first thing on here. Hopefull this will open the way to write more nonsense. I find this want for perfection messes with me the most for writing.

Here's to getting something done!
