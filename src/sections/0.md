Everytime I think about working on this site I get caught up trying to figure out what the perfect first couple posts would be. I wanted to make sure it's not some silly small thought I have on my mind at the moment, but something meaningful. Something that made sense. This is very much a perfect is the enemy of the good situation.

This post seems like a good compromise to me. It both feels meaningfullish and makes sense as a first thing here. Hopefully this will open the way to write more nonsense. I find this want for perfection messes with me the most for writing.

Here's to getting something done!
