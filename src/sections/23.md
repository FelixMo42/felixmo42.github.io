[Still a draft!]

Taosim is in a sense a refusal to do the utilitarian calculus. Or, more charitably, have the humility to realize we lack the knowledge to ever make them in the first place.  Or or, more interestingly, doing the calculation, and coming to the conclusion the best outcome is not to calculate in the first place.

The next three paragraphs will address each of theses sentences in order.

"Taosim is in a sense a refusal to do the utilitarian calculus." One of tenents of Taosim is that everybad thing is actually good. Ie: Allways a silver lining, but brough to it's extreme. Something along the line of beliving god always has a plan. Beliving everything the happens is ultimitly for the better. This used to annoy me a lot when people did this, cause obviously some outcomes are better than other, but I've since come to respect acting as if that's not true.

"Or, more charitably, have the humility to realize we lack the knowledge to ever make them in the first place." The world is an unfatamably complicated place. We can't know how everything will turn out.

"Or or, more interestingly, doing the calculation, and coming to the conclusion the best outcome is not to calculate in the first place." Would we be happier if we treated every possible outcome with indifrence?

TODO: This needs a lot of clean up and editing.
