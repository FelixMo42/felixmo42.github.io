My dad is fond of saying that happiness is reality minus expectation. He takes this and chooses to work on reality. Taoism is the idea to instead adjust expectations (in part, as far as my limited understanding goes).

Taking radical acceptance to its extreme says we shouldn't try to influence reality at all. Should the oppressed try to just be happy with their position? No, that seems unconscionable to me.

So, how do you determine what to change and what to accept? If I can adjust my expectations and be happy anywhere, then I think I should live in such a way to <a href="#utilitarianism">improve the lives of others as much as possible.</a>
