My favorite band are the Gorillaz.

I used to say they were a very unequal band, ie: I thought they had fantastic songs, but also some just some awful ones. I was wrong. I've been recetly relistening to everything they've ever made. They hit it out of the park everytime.

Fun fact: The only artical of clothing I ever baught using my own money that wasent thrifted was a Gorillaz tee shirt from hot topic.
