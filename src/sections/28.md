If curiosity killed the cat, then butter me up and call me a biscuit, cause I'm toast.

Mytery novels, with rare exeption, I have it on good athority, are terrible. And I admit, they usally don't contain much of the the thematic depth and insight into the human condition that I usally makes me love a book. But something about them is like just lights up my neurons.
