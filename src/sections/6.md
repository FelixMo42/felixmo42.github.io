I think utilitarianism is pretty neat. Morality is ultimately subjective, but I like people to be happy and full of love. Utilitarianism is about maximizing that. If you think that there is a different moral philosophy that is better at making people happy, then utilitarianism says we should act according to it.

The only problem is that it's, like most things, very complicated in its simplicity. Will buying this or that have a positive postivie impact not only on my happiness, but on that of every other person alive now and in the future?

This understandably causes disagreement on how we should act. I have <a href="#toaism">opinions</a>, but not the truth. Hopefully the scientific method can help us approach it.
