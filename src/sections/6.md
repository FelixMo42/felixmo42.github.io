I think utilitarianism is pretty neat. Morality is ultimitly subjective, but I like people to be happy and full of love. Utilitarianism is about maximizing that. If you think that there a diffrent moral philosophy that better at making people happy, than utilitarianism sais we should act according to that fashion.

The only problem is that it's, like most things, very complicated in its simplicity. Will buying this or that have a greater postivie impact not only on my happiness, but on that of every other person alive and in the future?

This understandaly causes disagrement on how we should act. I have <a href="#toaism">opinions</a>, but not the truth. Hopefully the scientific method can help us approach it.
