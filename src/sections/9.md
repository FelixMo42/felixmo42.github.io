Shame has more contol over my life than I'd like. When I tell my friend about this some of them are suprised. I play a very zany and out there character.

I was taking the amtrak once and ended up talking to a group of socal workers a little order the me. When they asked what I did, I beant the truth of about motili and didn't mention that I worked as a software developer.

In general I feel shame about the parts of my the conform to hegimonic society. I feel shame about how much money I make, about my job, about some of my interest (books are my only cool interest). Even my interest in how to improve the world feels like I'm just trying to show off or shame people when I talk about it.

I don't think this is healty. I hope voicing this while help me change.

Fun fact: I actuall wrote the post on <a href="#anger">Anger</a> first, but reorginzed them to bury this. Have fun guessing what wierd edits I've made to le site!
