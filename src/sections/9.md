Shame has more contol over my life than I'd like. I think my shame comes in two diffrent forms: fear of judjment and fear of hurting others.

<i>Fear of judjment</i>: While writing post for this blog I keep obsesing about not writing to much, or too little. Or not being too frivolous. And a million other things. When I tell my friend about this some of them are suprised. I play a very zany and out there character.



<i>Fear of hurting others:</i> A while back someone asked me out. I have immense respect for them (and love, I said yes!). I don't think I could do that the way I am right now. The catch is, I don't know if I want to change.
