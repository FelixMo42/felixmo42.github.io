Shame has more control over my life than I'd like. When I tell my friend about this some of them are surprised. I play a very zany and out there character.

I was taking the amtrak once and ended up talking to a group of social workers a little order the me. When they asked what I did, I beant the truth about Motili and didn't mention that I worked as a software developer.

In general I feel shame about the parts of my the conform to hegimonic society. I feel shame about how much money I make, about my job, about some of my interest (books are my only cool interest). Even my interest in how to improve the world feels like I'm just trying to show off or shame people when I talk about it.

I don't think this is healthy. I hope voicing this while help me change.

Fun fact: I actually wrote the post on <a href="#anger">Anger</a> first, but reorganized them to bury this. Have fun guessing what weird edits I've made to le site!

Edit: This makes me sound far too cool. I'm also ashamed of a bunch of other regular things. I don't even know what I'm doing.

Incomplete list of things I'm ashamed of:
- Working in Tech
- Not knowing the months of the year
- Knowing too much about online political figures
- Being well off
- Youtube
- Talking about relationships/emotions with my parents
- Flunking out of college (I'm getting better on this one)
- Walking around out side wearing a bunny suit
