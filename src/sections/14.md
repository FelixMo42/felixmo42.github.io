Nazil from NM got me the inside tip on EDM Rave. The IG post simply said it was happening at a secret location. The secret location happened to be under a train. Everytime a train came overhead we would cheer as its thundering clanging drowned out the music.

I was dancing pretty hard, but the crowd was small and there were only a couple of us really going at it. Nazil didn't come after all, so instead I ended up talking to a electrical engineering freshman called Victor. We even walked home together since we lived in the same direction.

I don't know why, but I sometimes like to invent alternate versions of myself while talking to new people I don't ever think I'll see again. During our first brief interaction I told him I was a French exchange student and just rolled with it the rest of the night. Everything else I told him about me was basically true, with the exception of inventing a time where I slept at the Richmond bart station waiting for the first amtrak train in the morning.

This time it might back fire on me. At the end he asked for my IG and I even told him about NM so we will see what happens.

The good news, is he's a chill and interesting dude. His hobby is collection and cataloging digital music files. His specialty was rare 2010's emo music. He would find them from long forgotten website or download them from peer-to-peer file sharing systems (usually not torrent, other less well known things). He then also hosted them. Apparently he has a couple thousand albums hosted!
