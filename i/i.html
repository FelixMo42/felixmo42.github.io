Who do <b>I</b> refer to when <b>I</b> say <b>I</b>?

This is still, for me, an idea in the process of being formed.

The first thing to keep in mind is that identity, as well as all other words, are imaginary. A good illustation of what I mean in my frustration with the ship of thesius.

<br><br>

For the uninitiated: The Ship of Theseus is a thought experiment about whether an object which has had all of its original components replaced remains the same object. If you replace all the parts of a boat slowly one by one over the years, when is it not the same boat? What if you build a new boat out of the old pieces of the boat? Or split a boat in half and reconstruct both parts?

I think the solution to this conundrum is very simple. Words and identity are imaginary. The reality of the situation is just the simple reality of wood, fabric and nail in a certain configuration. Saying 'ship' is just labels we put over the infinitely complex reality (for that matter, you can repeat the process for wood and everything else till you get down to the fundamental building blocks of the universe). This allows us to simplify and communicate with one another, but it's important to never lose sight of the fact that words are constantly changing imperfect representations of the world.

Is water wet? No one cares. Let's agree on a definition and get back to cooking or whatever we were doing before this topic came up.
