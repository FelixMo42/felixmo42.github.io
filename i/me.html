I am Felix Moses.

<br><br>

I was born in San Fransico December 11th 2001. We lived there till my brother was born in 2004 and then moved to Berkeley, but the memories from that period of my life are mostly none existant. The only one I have is looking out at the bamboo in the back yard right before we move away.
